# Parkimeter Management Application
 
This project is a Java-based application that allows users to manage a database of parkimeters through a basic graphical user interface (GUI). The application enables users to perform various actions related to car parking management.

## Development

This application was developed entirely in Java. Both collaborators were responsible for creating all the necessary SQL queries and statements to handle user actions within the application. These SQL operations include managing car park registrations, deletions, querying overdue parkings, and more. In addition to the database operations, both collaborators contributed to modifying and implementing various aspects of the GUI, although the core GUI was provided by the course instructors.
